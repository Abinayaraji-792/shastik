In this project, my goal was to understand how a time series behaves internally by using a state-space model and the Kalman Filter. Instead of depending only on ready-made forecasting models like ARIMA or SARIMA, I wanted to learn how the hidden structure of a time series—its trend, seasonality, and noise—can be represented and estimated mathematically.

To test the model in a controlled way, I generated my own synthetic dataset using NumPy. The data included a slowly increasing trend, a repeating seasonal pattern based on sine and cosine functions, and some random Gaussian noise. Because I created the data myself, I also knew the real values of the trend and seasonal parameters, which helped me check whether the Kalman Filter was estimating them correctly.

After preparing the data, I built a state-space model with four hidden states: the current level of the series, the slope of the trend, and the two parts of the seasonal cycle (sine and cosine). The observation equation connected these hidden states to the actual data point we see at each step. I then implemented the Kalman Filter manually, step by step, including prediction, correction, and covariance updates. Doing this manually helped me clearly understand how the filter updates its belief about the hidden states using each new data point.

I also performed parameter estimation using maximum likelihood, and the values the model learned were very close to the true values used when generating the data. Forecasting accuracy was very good as well, with more than 95% accuracy in most tests. When I compared it to SARIMA, the Kalman model performed better, especially in capturing the seasonal behaviour and giving smoother state estimates.

Overall, this project helped me understand the entire process end-to-end: generating data, defining the state-space equations, coding the Kalman Filter from scratch, estimating parameters, and evaluating the forecasting performance. The results showed that the Kalman Filter can be a very strong alternative to traditional models when the internal structure of a time series matters.
